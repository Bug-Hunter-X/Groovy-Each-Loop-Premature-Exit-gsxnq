# Groovy Each Loop Premature Exit
This example demonstrates a common error in Groovy where using `return` inside an `each` loop unexpectedly exits the entire loop instead of just the current iteration.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and missed processing of list elements.

The `bug.groovy` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version.
